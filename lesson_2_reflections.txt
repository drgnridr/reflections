What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Whatever files I have on the working directory I change and add them to the staging area whenever the change has been made to one file. Then I commit only when the logical change has been brought over in all the files.
